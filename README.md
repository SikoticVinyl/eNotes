## Description
This project was to work on my skills with express.js and using GET, POST, and DELETE methods. I was a bit overwhemled when we first went through this information in class but getting to work with it in this way I picked it up rather quickly. I had a lot of fun going through and debugging things as they came up to make sure they were connected correctly - specifically this happened a lot when getting the uuid setup for this project. When I first tired to call it I called it in a file that could not use node and had to convert it to properly work across the different types of files.

The Heroku deployment was another pain part of this project but my best guess is I simply did not have the most updated version of Heroku and once I updated initially I forgot to restart my GitBash so my updates were saying they were pushing when really they were not. Finally I ended up removing everything from my computer since I had the working version of code in my github and re-cloned, setup and deployed to Heroku with the properly updated version in my command line and everything went through really smoothly. I went through a couple of troubleshooting steps still before my solution that I feel more comfortable working with Heroku and understanding the troubleshooting side of it.

Overall, it was a great first step looking into and seeing how the backend stuff we are working through and learning is connecting to the front end user interface without having built it all out myself yet. 

This project is now a fully functioning Note Tracker!

When you access the application, you will be able to create, store and re-access notes as well as delete notes you no longer need.
